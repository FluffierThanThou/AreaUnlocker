Removes the (arbitrary) limit to the number of areas you can create.

# Notes
While this completely removes the limit on the number of areas you can create, the UI is untouched - and optimized for 5 areas per type. If you create too many areas, you may run into UI issues. This practical limit depends largely on your resolution. I have no plans to update these UI issues, as that would be a massive undertaking.
